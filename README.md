### Debugging JavaScript
- Use the console.log
- Console.error -> search the specific error online
- Remove sections of code and run elsewhere (code sandbox)

### Debugging network requests
Rest clients - a tool which allows you to send HTTP requests to server and see the response
Use browsers built in dev tools


### Debugging HTML & CSS
CSS temporary borders and backgrounds
Use the screen reader to test elements 
Using mobile view 
Mobile first
Debug: add and style elements to see how they respond 

### Asynchronous JavaScript
Reads from top to bottom (handles sequentially)
JavaScript uses promises to carry out different tasks before others have completed
Promises are objects with a .then method that waits for the previous line of code to complete before running
“synchronous” vs “asynchronous” - synchronous is less flexible, requires all lines of code to be complete in order to work
Callbacks - an item that is yet to be defined
